<div class="hidden_details">
<div class="descriptions">
<p>I had the privilege of interning as a technical buyer at DRiV Incorporated, a renowned global provider of automotive components and services. With its footprint in over 150 countries, DRiV stands as an influential force in the automotive realm, tirelessly pushing the boundaries of innovation and championing sustainability to reshape the future of mobility.

    DRiV's extensive product suite encompasses brakes, chassis, engine components, steering mechanisms, thermal management systems, and wipers. Beyond products, they offer an array of services, from remanufacturing to engineering and distribution. Their dedication to advancement is evident in their investments in cutting-edge technologies, like electric and self-driving vehicles, all while prioritizing a reduced environmental footprint.
    
    During my tenure, I engaged in diverse projects aimed at refining DRiV's procurement efficiencies. I spearheaded the strategic exploration of supplier partnerships within the burgeoning African auto market. Furthermore, I adeptly orchestrated the transfer of components and injection moulds between suppliers, unlocking considerable cost efficiencies. Working in tandem with the product development squad, I was pivotal in identifying optimal materials and components for the introduction of new products in engine and transmission sectors across Europe, Middle East, and Africa.
    
    My experiences provided a deep dive into crafting procurement tactics to guarantee cost-efficient sourcing of materials, parts, and machinery. I was actively involved in the global vendor development, rigorously evaluating suppliers on quality, dependability, and cost metrics. Handling documentation, from RFIs to RFQs, I took charge of quote analyses, price negotiations, and contract drafting. I maintained robust supplier relationships, conducted audits, ensured adherence to standards, and streamlined approval processes for PPAP, PSW, and BOM. My efforts in analysing cost discrepancies and performing spend analyses were instrumental in crafting monthly cost-saving reports. Additionally, I was part of the team that leveraged the Lean Six Sigma framework to pinpoint potential improvements in our purchasing procedures.
    
    Reflecting on my internship, I'm immensely proud of my contributions and the knowledge I amassed. This experience has equipped me with invaluable insights that I believe will greatly serve my evolving career. Eagerly, I look forward to my continued association with DRiV and propelling their vision further.</p>

<div class="hidden_details">
<div class="descriptions">
<p>During my master's studies, I had the privilege of serving as a procurement assistant at Carrefour Retail in Bordeaux, France. Carrefour is more than just a store; it's a behemoth in the retail landscape. Originating from Massy, France, this multinational retail titan stands as the world's eighth-largest retailer by revenue. With a sprawling network of hypermarkets, grocery stores, and convenience outlets that number 13,894 across over 30 countries, Carrefour has etched its mark. These stores house everything from food and beverages to household items and electronics, consistently upholding Carrefour's pledge of superior quality products at competitive prices.

    In this dynamic environment, my role was multifaceted. I was a steady support to the store manager, particularly in the realms of procurement and inventory management. Together, we ensured that our deliveries were always timely, and we keenly forecasted the weekly demand for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). With an eye for detail, I managed our store's inventory, ensuring that our stock levels were always optimal. Restocking wasn't just a reactive task; it was about anticipating our customers' needs and initiating replenishment orders accordingly.
    
    Furthermore, strategy was paramount. The store manager and I collaborated intensively to develop and implement key procurement strategies. Our approach was grounded in efficiency: we adopted just-in-time purchasing methods, ensuring that our store ordered goods precisely when needed. Seasonal shifts bring with them varied consumer demands, and here again, my role was crucial. I assisted the manager in seasonal forecasting, predicting the ebb and flow of product demands as seasons changed.
    
    Looking at my time at Carrefour Retail, the sense of accomplishment is profound. Not only did I contribute tangibly to the store's operations, but I also amassed a wealth of experience that I'm confident will serve me well as I advance in my procurement career. It's a journey I'm genuinely excited about, knowing I have the skills and insights to make meaningful contributions to businesses in the future.</p>

<p>UMAC Avionics, Bengaluru, India</p>
</div>
<a class="elisc_tm_full_link" href="#"></a>

<div class="hidden_details">
<div class="descriptions">
<p>At UMAC Avionics, a distinguished marketing and consulting company in India established in 1987, I wore the hat of a procurement engineer. This firm, deeply embedded in the aerospace and defence industries, has built its reputation through steadfast commitments to quality and client satisfaction. UMAC Avionics, through its global partnerships with various manufacturers, exemplifies sustainable, quality-driven growth, enhancing value to its broad clientele, which includes eminent entities such as the Indian Air Force, the Indian Navy, and the Indian Space Research Organisation.

    The ethos of UMAC Avionics revolves around delivering unparalleled service and unwavering support, and this is made possible by a team of seasoned professionals. They bring to the table a depth of expertise and knowledge, ensuring that the unique demands of every client are met.
    
    During my tenure, my role saw me navigating a spectrum of responsibilities. Collaborating closely with the procurement team, I identified countries where we could source raw materials and avionic equipment at a reduced cost, ushering in a significant financial advantage for the firm. I also delved deep into client tender documents, discerning their key stipulations, and ensuring our submissions perfectly aligned with their requirements. My quest for efficiency led me to conduct comprehensive global supplier research, focusing on those providing aerospace-grade materials and equipment. Through this, I facilitated the generation and dispatch of RFQs and RFPs to potential suppliers.
    
    One of the highlights of my role was leveraging reverse auctions. This strategy ensured we consistently landed the best prices for our raw materials and equipment. Alongside this, I kept a keen eye on the market, analyzing competitor activities to ensure our pricing remained sharp and competitive. Negotiating contracts with suppliers became second nature to me, and these negotiations played a pivotal role in consolidating our market position.
    
    To keep the operations streamlined, I maintained a structured database encompassing all tender documents and pertinent information. This database became an invaluable tool, simplifying tracking and ensuring we missed no opportunities. Furthermore, I routinely provided guidance to the sales team, illuminating potential tender opportunities and clarifying any technical uncertainties. An integral part of my role was also liaising with internal teams, ensuring a seamless transition from purchase requisitions to the issuance of purchase orders. This coordination ensured we always met our delivery commitments, both in terms of timing and budget.
    
    Looking back, my time at UMAC Avionics fills me with a sense of accomplishment. Every strategy implemented, every negotiation conducted, and every process streamlined has left an indelible mark on the company's success trajectory. As I set my sights on future opportunities in procurement, I carry with me a rich tapestry of experiences, ready to help other businesses scale new heights..</p>

<p>Prism Surface Coating, Bengaluru, India</p>

<a class="elisc_tm_full_link" href="#"></a>

<div class="hidden_details">
<div class="descriptions">
<p>My professional journey began at Prism Surface Coatings, a global frontrunner and one of India's premier entities in the domain of turnkey powder coating lines/plants, liquid painting plants/lines, and various other industry essentials like paint booths, blast rooms, and 3-axis painting platforms. A testament to Prism's global footprint is its 700+ installations sprawled across 30+ countries. The company's acquisition of OMT Surface Teknik Germany, a trailblazer in powder coating lines and painting plants, further bolstered its portfolio, enabling it to offer German-engineered solutions at Indian manufacturing costs.

    Within this dynamic setting, I assumed the role of a Junior Project Engineer specializing in procurement. My mandate involved closely liaising with diverse teams to discern procurement needs, leading the charge in actualizing these requirements in line with established protocols. My tenure saw me nurturing robust vendor relationships, orchestrating contract negotiations, ensuring cost-efficiency, and guaranteeing the punctual arrival of vital raw materials and services. I was at the helm of the procure-to-pay (P2P) trajectory, ensuring meticulous and compliant record-keeping.
    
    Financial acumen played a pivotal role in my functions, be it monitoring project finances, discerning avenues for economizing, or instituting effective cost containment methodologies. I frequently dabbled in intricate aspects of contract management, steering negotiations and effectively resolving discrepancies. Keeping stakeholders in the loop was vital; I routinely updated them about procurement milestones and swiftly tackled arising challenges. My independent oversight extended to the annual maintenance contracts' procurement, where I brought innovation to the table, devising procurement blueprints for consumables and logistics. This strategy bore fruit, translating into cost reductions to the tune of approximately INR 0.3 million for each project.
    
    Additionally, I made significant strides in the strategic planning realm of the Business Development division, pioneering the introduction of the globe's most expansive digital repository on powder coating and painting lines.</p>
